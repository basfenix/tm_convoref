•  **Quick Chat Reference ** Adds a  button to TypingMind's interface that lets you access your past conversations without leaving the current chat

•  **Searchable History**  Provides a modal window with a search function to easily find specific past conversations from your local browser storage

•  **One-Click Insertion**  Lets you insert formatted references from previous chats directly into your current prompt with proper formatting and attribution

hope it's useful to someone out there.
